# Automated Planning: Theory and Practice

This repository contains the project developed by Alessandro Zinni and Pierluca Faccin for the master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Systems at the University of Trento.

## Overview

This project is focused on the field of automated planning and covers various aspects of the theory and practice of planning. The repository contains 5 folders, each of which presents the domain and problem files for each assigned problem.

## Folders

- Problem1: Contains the domain and problem files for the first assigned problem and the results.txt to see the plan generated.
- Problem2: Contains the domain and problem files for the second assigned problem.
- Problem3: Contains the domain and problem files for the third assigned problem.
- Problem4: Contains the domain and problem files for the fourth assigned problem.
- Problem5: Contains the domain and problem files for the fifth assigned problem.

## Usage

To use the files in this repository, you will need a planning system such as Fast Downward or any other PDDL-compatible planner. The domain and problem files can be used as input to the planner to generate a plan to solve the corresponding problem.
